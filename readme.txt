By Mike Teixeira

The program contains two instruments panned hard left and right. Both instruments have three controllable parameters:
-the carrier frequency
-a frequency modulation control
-an amplitude modulation control

Switch between instruments with O.
Switch between parameters with M.
Click and drag to alter the current parameter.

Frequency and amplitude modulation are disabled by default on both instruments. Toggle them with F and A.
